# Rick-and-Morty-React-App-Card-API
Using the Rick and Morty api to display cards of the Characters

I made a quick React App that you guys can clone for practice with Props! 

Everything's already set up for you, so you can `Fork` it, `Clone` it, and open it up. 

Run `npm i` to download the dependacies and `npm start` to run the server.

Don't worry about the useEffect or Axios call, I'll explain those during Standup and why I used them. Focus on the `properties`. Which `properties` in the `Card.js` are missing? How do we access them? Do you know where to find the `properties` that we need? What are `properties`?
